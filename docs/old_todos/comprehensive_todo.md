# Invoice Extraction Project - Comprehensive TODO

## Project Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive task list for the invoice extraction system. The goal is to improve architecture, maintainability, and extensibility while preserving existing functionality.

## Current Status Summary

### Key Achievements
