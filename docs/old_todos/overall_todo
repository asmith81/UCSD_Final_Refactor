## Current Progress Summary
Approximately 80% of the planned refactoring has been completed. Major systems like configuration, model management (including quantization), prompt system, and execution pipeline are now fully implemented. Results management and experiment configurability are partially complete, with the core components in place but some additional features and testing still needed.

## Next Steps Priority
1. Complete remaining aspects of results management visualization
2. Add comprehensive testing for all implemented components
3. Improve documentation coverage
4. Implement notebook integration for easier experiment configuration
5. Add containerization support for deployment
