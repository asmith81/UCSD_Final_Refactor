# Software Testing Guide for the Pipeline Implementation

I understand you're new to software testing. I'll explain how to set up and implement tests for our pipeline system in practical terms.

## Test File Structure

Here's the file structure you would need to create:

```
src/
  tests/
    __init__.py                     # Makes the directory a Python package
    conftest.py                     # Test configuration and fixtures
    test_pipeline_factory.py        # Unit tests for the factory
    test_pipeline_service.py        # Unit tests for the pipeline service
    test_end_to_end/
      __init__.py
      test_basic_extraction.py      # Basic extraction test
      test_quantization.py          # Quantization comparison test
      test_prompt_comparison.py     # Prompt comparison test
      test_model_comparison.py      # Model comparison test
      test_hybrid_experiment.py     # Hybrid experiment test
    test_data/                      # Test data directory
      images/                       # Small set of test images
      ground_truth.csv              # Ground truth data for test images
      mock_responses/               # Mock model responses
```

## Test Environment Setup

1. **Python Testing Framework**:
   - We'll use `pytest`, which is the standard testing framework for Python
   - It's easy to install: `pip install pytest pytest-cov`

2. **Test Dependencies**:
   - Mock libraries: `pip install pytest-mock`
   - For testing with images: `pip install Pillow`
   - For measuring performance: `pip install pytest-benchmark`

3. **Testing Environment**:
   - You'll need a virtual environment with all project dependencies installed
   - Tests should run in an environment similar to your development environment

## How to Implement Tests

Let's look at an example of how you would implement a basic test:

```python
# src/tests/test_end_to_end/test_basic_extraction.py

import os
import pytest
from src.config.experiment import ExperimentConfiguration
from src.execution.pipeline.factory import create_extraction_pipeline

# This is a test fixture - it sets up the test environment
@pytest.fixture
def test_config():
    """Create a test configuration for extraction."""
    return ExperimentConfiguration(
        name="test_extraction",
        model_name="test_model",
        fields_to_extract=["work_order"],
        dataset={
            "source": "test",
            "limit": 5  # Only process 5 test images
        }
    )

# This is an actual test function
def test_basic_extraction_pipeline(test_config, monkeypatch):
    """Test that basic extraction pipeline works end-to-end."""
    # Set up test environment
    monkeypatch.setenv("TEST_MODE", "True")
    monkeypatch.setattr("src.models.model_service.get_model", mock_get_model)
    
    # Create pipeline using factory
    pipeline = create_extraction_pipeline(test_config)
    
    # Run the pipeline
    result = pipeline.run()
    
    # Verify results are as expected
    assert result.status == "success"
    assert "field_extractions" in result.stage_results
    
    # Check extraction results
    extractions = result.stage_results["field_extractions"]
    assert "work_order" in extractions
    
    # Verify at least some extractions worked
    work_order_results = extractions["work_order"]["prompt_results"]
    for prompt_name, results in work_order_results.items():
        success_count = sum(1 for r in results if r.get("exact_match", False))
        assert success_count > 0, f"No successful extractions for prompt {prompt_name}"
```

## Mock Components

For testing, you'll need mock components to avoid dependencies on real models:

```python
# src/tests/conftest.py

import pytest
import json
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Mock model class that returns predetermined results
class MockModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.responses = {}
        self._load_mock_responses()
    
    def _load_mock_responses(self):
        # Load prepared mock responses from files
        mock_dir = Path(__file__).parent / "test_data" / "mock_responses"
        for response_file in mock_dir.glob("*.json"):
            with open(response_file, 'r') as f:
                self.responses[response_file.stem] = json.load(f)
    
    def generate(self, prompt, image=None):
        # Look up pre-defined response based on image ID
        image_id = os.path.basename(image).split('.')[0] if image else "default"
        return self.responses.get(image_id, {"extraction": "mock_value"})

# This makes the mock model available to all tests
@pytest.fixture
def mock_model():
    return MockModel()

# This function replaces the real model loading function
def mock_get_model(model_name, **kwargs):
    return MockModel()
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you would:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to your project root directory
3. Run the tests with one of these commands:
   - `pytest` (runs all tests)
   - `pytest src/tests/test_end_to_end/test_basic_extraction.py` (runs a specific test file)
   - `pytest -xvs` (runs with more verbose output)

Example:
```bash
cd /path/to/project
python -m pytest src/tests/test_end_to_end/
```

## Test Data Requirements

You'll need to prepare:

1. A small set of test images (5-10)
2. A ground truth CSV file with known values for those images
3. Mock model responses (what the model would output for each test image)

## Continuous Integration

Once tests are set up, you could integrate them with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Run Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest pytest-cov
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest --cov=src/
```

## Tips for Creating Tests

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic functionality tests
2. **Use small datasets**: For faster test execution
3. **Mock external dependencies**: Avoid relying on actual models or APIs
4. **Test for both success and failure**: Ensure error handling works
5. **Use descriptive test names**: Makes it clear what's being tested
6. **Run tests often**: Catch issues early

Remember, the goal is to verify that your code works as expected, both for individual components and for the system as a whole.
