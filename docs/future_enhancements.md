## Implementation Timeline Guidance

These enhancements should be prioritized based on user feedback after the core system is operational. A reasonable approach would be:

1. Start with extended documentation (3-4 weeks after initial release)
2. Implement advanced visualization (4-6 weeks after initial release)
3. Add performance optimizations (6-8 weeks after initial release)
4. Develop comprehensive testing framework (8-12 weeks after initial release)
5. Add advanced pipeline and deployment features (12+ weeks after initial release)
