# Essential To-Do List (Critical Path)

This document outlines the critical tasks that need to be completed to make the system fully operational.

## 1. Documentation (Critical Path)

- [x] Create `docs/setup_guide.md` with RunPod-specific instructions
  - Document environment requirements (GPU, RAM, storage)
  - Step-by-step setup process on RunPod
  - Required dependencies and installation commands
  - Validation steps to ensure environment is properly configured

- [x] Create a basic `docs/architecture.md` showing main component relationships
  - Include a simple architecture diagram
  - Document key interfaces and data flow
  - Explain the pipeline stages and their responsibilities
  - Describe the configuration system organization

- [x] Document key interfaces in `docs/interfaces.md`
  - Focus on pipeline and experiment configuration interfaces
  - Document model service interface
  - Document prompt system interface
  - Document results collection and analysis interfaces

## 2. Core Notebooks

- [x] Create `notebooks/01_environment_setup.ipynb`
  - Environment checks and validation
  - Dependency installation
  - GPU verification
  - Path configuration
  - System readiness tests

- [x] Create `notebooks/02_experiment_configuration.ipynb`
  - Basic experiment templates
  - Model selection
  - Field and prompt selection
  - Quantization configuration
  - Pipeline creation and execution
  - Results storage and basic visualization

- [x] Create `notebooks/03_results_analysis.ipynb`
  - Results loading
  - Experiment comparison
  - Performance visualization
  - Report generation
  - Error analysis

## 3. Support Modules

- [x] Create `src/notebook/setup_utils.py`
  - Environment detection functions
  - Dependency verification
  - GPU memory checking
  - Path configuration utilities
  - Error handling for setup issues

- [x] Create `src/notebook/experiment_utils.py`
  - Experiment template loading
  - Configuration helper functions
  - Pipeline initialization utilities
  - Simplified interfaces for common experiment types

## 4. Error Handling Enhancements

- [x] Add clearer error messages at critical failure points
  - Model loading failures
  - Stage transitions
  - Configuration errors
  - Data validation errors

- [x] Implement basic error logging
  - Log failures with context information
  - Create categorized error messages
  - Add debug information for RunPod specific issues
  - Implement error summary generation

## 5. Minimal Testing

- [ ] Create a simple smoke test for the basic extraction pipeline
  - Test with a small sample of invoice images
  - Verify end-to-end extraction functionality
  - Check result storage and retrieval
  - Validate visualization generation

## Completion Criteria

The system will be considered operational when:

1. Users can set up the environment correctly in RunPod
2. Users can configure and run basic extraction experiments
3. Users can visualize and analyze results
4. Critical errors have clear messages and recovery paths
5. The core pipeline functions reliably on RunPod
